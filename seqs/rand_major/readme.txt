These are randomly generated sequences for the Behringer Crave synthesizer.

Loading them requires the free Synth Tool software from Behringer.
In Synth Tool go to the Sequencer section and "Import" a file. Then set Bank and Pattern and press "Store" to send the sequence to the Crave.
If the Crave is currently set to that bank and pattern you may have to select a different pattern then re-select the one you just sent to get it to reload.

The filename gives the scale/mode and the number of steps in the sequence (16 or 32).
As well as randomising the notes (but adhering to the given scale) I also randomised ratchets, rests, accent and glide. The nature of randomly generated stuff means that some will sound better than others. Feel free to tweak!
